        Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure <br>
        about how to get the right
        word. To crack the code for the UX copies, we at Zeta Design <br>
        wanted to build a Figma plugin for the larger design
        community. The <br>
        plugin is called the Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX copies cataloged and categorized with a voice and
        tone <br>
        variation ranging from plain, casual to playful. The intention to build this Figma plugin <br>
        originated from our
        Medium blog post, ‘Designing voice and tone for error messages.
